# Welcome to my digital resume
This resume was coded from scratch in a few hours to showcase my HTML and CSS skills using only TextEdit. I challenged myself to see how quickly I could create something by relying only on my internal knowledge.

Also, my previous resume was made in Illustrator and I no longer have it installed and I felt that this would be the fastest way to recreate it.
